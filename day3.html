 <h1>day 3</h1>
<div class="icon">
    <i class="fas fa-user-lock"></i>class will begin when all the cameras are on, or a good reason why its off.  
    <i class="fas fa-award"></i>awards from yesterday, if you recieve the award, you have 30 seconds from "ready!" to draw and write the title.   
    <i class="far fa-question-circle"></i>anybody in the group can ask <i class="far fa-question-circle fa-spin"></i>questions now until 10 seconds of silence.
    <i class="fas fa-stopwatch-20"></i>a round is up to 20 minutes.  we will encounter each icon to varying depth depending on group needs, if we finish the whole loop, secret reward activates
    <i class="fas fa-user-secret"></i> you are already music producers.  production = work, and work= energy/time. <i class="fas fa-business-time"></i> music=music, so you just have to combine the two together.  simple!
    <i class="fas fa-kiwi-bird"></i>WingBird1 has another video for you.
    <i class="fas fa-unlock-alt"></i>Today's 1st unlock is WB2, MV has been uploaded in the group. <i class="fas fa-water"></i>find the sound of water (online or however you want), make it loop on ableton.  play with layers and EQ.  do something rhythmic.  where in the world is your seaside?  
    <i class="fas fa-calendar-day"></i>In a musical way, produce by pen or computer a daily or weekly calendar of your schedule.  CLEARLY MARK MUSIC-MAKING TIME.  
    <i class="fas fa-user-friends"></i>you have your own wingbird to help you present your story or folk tale. 
    
    <i class="fas fa-history"></i>as you already know, repetition is one of the keys to music production.  patience and practice, combined with your unique mindset and history make what? If you didn't learn anything useful from the "30 minutes of music theory", why do you think that is? WB#1 review?  review all icons?  your choice.
    <i class="fas fa-comment-slash"></i>yesterday we watched a video and then tried to give it a title.  tomorrow we will make more 
    <i class="fas fa-language"></i>我是美国。It is amazing that you are learning from me in English, what if we used a little time each cycle to teach me one single word in chinese.  repeated cycles can check my understanding or add new words or context.
    <i class="far fa-compass"></i>Ableton is your car, get in and drive. While you are first learning to drive, we take you to the parking lot to learn the basics.  Music Production has no GPS, you need a compass and a destination.  Like this course, remember what is our destination? 
    <i class="far fa-eye"></i>remember our destination, 10 days to get you to at least one sharable song in our class album.
    <i class="fas fa-atlas"></i>the three dragons (point zero:)? <img src="../course-source-err/images/World-listening-to-music.jpg">
    <i class="fas fa-feather-alt"></i>write your plan for 5 minutes.  write a comment about the reading.  write a question down for the next opportunity.
